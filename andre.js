When H+ ions flow back through ATP Synthase via facilitated diffusion (down their concentration gradient), the energy released drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi.

It consists of two coupled processes: (1) The ETC, where electrons are transferred through protein complexes, releasing energy that pumps H+ ions across the membrane, and (2) Chemiosmosis, where the resulting proton gradient drives ATP Synthase to phosphorylate ADP into ATP. This process produces ~32-34 ATP per glucose - the majority of ATP from cellular respiration. It's called 'oxidative' because oxygen is the final electron acceptor."

Together, these create a powerful force called the proton-motive force that drives H+ ions back through ATP Synthase, powering ATP production. The ETC builds this gradient through active transport of H+ ions."
